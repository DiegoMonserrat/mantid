Description
-----------

Save 1D plots to a png file, as part of autoreduction. Multiple spectra
in the same workspace will be represented by curves on the same plot.
Groupped workspaces will be shown as subplots. If the workspace has more
than one spectra, but less or equal to ten, labels will be shown.

Note: the figures contain lines between points, no error bars.

Note: Requires matplotlib version>= 1.2.0
